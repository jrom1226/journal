## Things I Learned Today
    -I enjoyed putting together my group's blog post. It was a great way for me to also reflect about the ways 
    in which I have learned about Thoreau this semester and the significance behind his texts. Overall, it
    was a pleasureable experience because everyone in my group pulled their weight and was very supportive of one another.  
    I appreciate this experience even if it was under extreme circumstances. 

### Markdown

Wow! This is my *third* markdown file!

I'm impressed with myself for **these reasons**:
    -I've actually completed another one! 
    -I'm getting the hang of it and would have loved to earlier on

- I've learned something new about team work and collaboration! 
- I'm on my to becoming a [digital humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities)
